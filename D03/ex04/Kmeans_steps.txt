Steps for Kmeans :
1 - Select randomly as many centroids as clusters you wish to ouput
2 - Calculate distance for each data points to each centroids
3 - Form clusters through distance (points with same closest centroid = one cluster)
4 - Update centroid location through mean values of data points belonging to its cluster
5 - Repeat until convergence

Different way of calculating distance exist such as L1 distance (manhattan), L2 distance (euclidian),
cosine similarity...
